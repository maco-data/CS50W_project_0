### Description
First project from the course CS50W 2020 from Harvard University on edX. This is a clone of Google Search, Google Image Search and Google Advance Search website.

The project was build using HTML, CSS and SAAS.

For the project I implemented what I learn on the lectures and added the project to github using git and the skills lear in the lecture about it.

### Specification
The website meet the following requirements:

- The website have at least three pages: one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.
- On the Google Search page, there are links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there is a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.
- On the Google Search page, the user is able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.
- Like Google’s own, my search bar is centered with rounded corners. The search button is be centered, and is beneath the search bar.
- On the Google Image Search page, the user is able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
- On the Google Advanced Search page, the user is able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
  + Find pages with… “all these words:”
  + Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
  + Find pages with… “any of these words:”
  + Find pages with… “none of these words:”
  + Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.
- Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button is blue with white text.
- When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user is taken to the search results page for their given query.
- Added an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
You may encounter a redirect notice when using the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. Not to worry! This is an expected consequence of a security feature implemented by Google.
- The CSS I wrote should resemble Google’s own aesthetics and obviously I try, yet I'm notwhere perfect.
